        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="INTRODUCTION">2.
        Introduction</a></h1>

        <p>The Open Source Writers Group (OSWG - <a href= 
        "http://www.oswg.org" target="_top">
        http://www.oswg.org</a>) uses the DocBook SGML Document
        Type Definition (DTD) as its standard "source" format for
        all documentation, including books, articles, papers, FAQs,
        HOWTOs, mini-HOWTOs, and more.</p>

        <p>DocBook was chosen for a number of reasons -- it's a
        very verbose DTD, it covers almost every possible
        requirement for technical and other forms of documentation,
        and it is quickly becoming the standard DTD for open-source
        and open-content information. There are also a number of
        open-source tools available for processing DocBook
        instances, some of which work quite well. Additionally,
        Norman Walsh's modular DocBook stylesheets are freely
        available, very complete, and under active development. All
        of these things make DocBook a compelling choice as a
        standard SGML DTD.</p>

        <p>This document is a quick introduction to using DocBook
        to markup documentation that is intended to be kept in the
        Open Source Writers Group Concurrent Versions System (CVS).
        This CVS is freely available for any writer or group of
        writers who are working on free open-content documentation
        of any sort. For more information about the CVS system and
        the OSWG documentation licensing policies, please visit the
        OSWG website at <a href="http://www.oswg.org" target=
        "_top">http://www.oswg.org</a>.</p>

        <p>For a far more complete DocBook reference, visit <a
        href="http://www.docbook.org" target="_top">
        http://www.docbook.org</a>, the home of the electronic
        versions of Norman Walsh's <i class="CITETITLE">DocBook:
        The Definitive Guide</i> (published by O'Reilly <a href= 
        "http://www.oreilly.com" target="_top">
        http://www.oreilly.com</a>). Better yet, head on over to
        your local (real or virtual) bookshop and order a printed
        version. If you're going to delve into the wonderful world
        of DocBook, you will definitely get your money's worth out
        of Norman's book.</p>

        <p>If you're new to markup languages, I recommend you read
        at least the first two chapters of <i class="CITETITLE">
        DocBook: The Definitive Guide</i>, as these give an
        overview of HTML, SGML, and XML, as well as an introduction
        to the major concepts involved in doing structural and
        semantic markup.</p>

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="TOOLS">3. Tools</a></h1>

        <p>There are two different types of tool related to SGML --
        the tools you use to create SGML documents, and the tools
        you use to process SGML documents. These tools are very
        different, because they do completely different things.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AUTHORINGTOOLS">3.1. Authoring
          tools</a></h2>

          <p>As mentioned in the <a href="#INTRODUCTION"><i>
          Introduction</i></a>, you don't really need any special
          tools for creating or authoring DocBook documents. In
          fact, at the moment, your best bet is to use your
          favourite text editor. DocBook documents must be in
          plaintext ASCII, not in any special binary format. Thus,
          you can use vi, emacs, notepad, textpad, or any other
          text editor that allows you to produce plain ASCII
          output.</p>

          <p>There are some tools being developed that will allow
          you to create DocBook and other types of SGML documents
          without having to manually type in all the markup tags.
          At the moment, however, those tools are not available, or
          if they are available, they're not all that reliable. For
          now, it's recommended that you just use a text editor,
          and add your own markup tags by hand. It's a bit of a
          bother, but it's not difficult. The end result is
          definitely worth the time invested.</p>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="PROCESSINGTOOLS">3.2.
          Processing tools - DocBook Tools</a></h2>

          <p>SGML processing tools are sets of scripts and programs
          that are used to turn SGML documents into other output
          formats. It is during this processing that all formatting
          is added and the final versions of the documents are
          created.</p>

          <p>The OSWG uses a package called "DocBook Tools" to
          process the DocBook instances that are part of its
          documentation set. This package includes a set of scripts
          that simplify the use of a number of different programs,
          making it very easy to create a variety of different
          output formats, including HTML, PDF, PS, RTF, DVI, and
          TEX.</p>

            Tools</a></h3>

            <p>Using DocBook Tools is exceedingly simple. When you
            install the packages, a series of scripts are added to
            <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/bin</tt>. Each script turns
            your DocBook document into a different output format.
            The scripts are called:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b class="COMMAND">db2html</b> - DocBook to
                HTML</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><b class="COMMAND">db2dvi</b> - DocBook to
                DVI</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><b class="COMMAND">db2pdf</b> - DocBook to
                PDF</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><b class="COMMAND">db2ps</b> - DocBook to PS</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><b class="COMMAND">db2rtf</b> - DocBook to
                RTF</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Using these scripts is very simple, just type the
            script name on the command line followed by the name of
            the DocBook file you want to process. For example:</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
$ db2html my-document.sgml
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If you have any problems with this, you can ask for
            help on either of the mailing lists mentioned
            above.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT1">
        <hr>

        <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="GETTINGSTARTED">4. Getting
        Started</a></h1>

        <p>Using the DocBook DTD to mark up your documentation
        doesn't require any special tools at all. An SGML file
        (usually having a .sgml or .sgm filename extension) is
        actually just a plaintext ASCII file that contains text
        interspersed with SGML "tags". I strongly recommend that
        you use your favourite text editor (vi, emacs, notepad,
        what have you) for doing DocBook markup. It's very
        important that the files are plaintext ASCII, so using a
        full-blown wordprocessing system is not only overkill, you
        might end up creating non-ASCII files. Use a text editor,
        it's still the best and simplest way.</p>

        <p>A document that has been marked up with DocBook looks a
        lot like HTML in a lot of ways. For example, here's a very
        simple HTML page:</p>

        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My HTML Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#000000"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the first paragraph of the HTML page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the second paragraph of the HTML page.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Markup tags are the things that begin and end with the
        "&lt;" and "&gt;" brackets. A markup "start" tag, which
        indicates the beginning of an "element" in the page just
        has the brackets, while an "end" tag, indicating the end of
        an element, begins with a "&lt;/" combination. Anything
        contained within a start and end tag of the same type is a
        complete "element" within the page.</p>

        <p>So, what's an "element"? A document element is simply a
        section of the document that is defined by the tags which
        contain it. For example, the following is a complete HTML
        "H1" (heading level 1) element:</p>

        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&lt;h1&gt;This is a Level 1 Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Elements can contain certain other elements, as defined
        by the DTD. For example, an HTML "body" element can contain
        headings, paragraphs, lists, and a wide variety of others.
        For example:</p>

        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is a Level 1 Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is a paragraph.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>You will see that both the "h1" and "p" elements are
        contained by the "body" element.</p>

        <p>The similarities between HTML and DocBook SGML pretty
        much end here, however. HTML is a markup language that is
        used primarily to define the formatting or appearance of
        the page when it is displayed in an HTML browser. HTML is
        also very informal in terms of how the tags fit together
        and how strict the tag structure must be.</p>

        <p>DocBook SGML, however, is a markup language used to
        define the structure of a document, rather than its
        formatting. In DocBook there are no tags that you can use
        to make an element "bold" or "italic". Instead, you mark up
        the document by defining _what_ is in each element, rather
        than how each element should look. Here's a very simple
        DocBook example:</p>

        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V3.1//EN"&gt;
&lt;article&gt;

   &lt;artheader&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;This is the Article Title&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/artheader&gt;

   &lt;sect1&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;This is a Level 1 Section Title&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;para&gt;
      This is the first paragraph.
      &lt;/para&gt;
      &lt;para&gt;
      This is the second paragraph.
      &lt;/para&gt;
   &lt;/sect1&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>As you can see, there is no formatting information in
        this document.</p>

        <p>The "article" tags tell us that the document is an
        article. All other elements in the document are contained
        within this "root" element. The first pair of "title" tags
        indicate the article title, which is contained in the
        "artheader" (article header) element. The second set of
        "title" tags, contained by the "sect1" element, indicate
        the title of that section.</p>

        <p>So, what's that "DOCTYPE" tag at the very beginning?
        That's the "document type declaration" which is how we
        define what type of SGML document this is and which DTD
        we're using for the markup. You don't have to understand
        the document type declaration, you just have to make sure
        that it's at the top of all the documents you markup using
        DocBook. You might have to change the word after "DOCTYPE",
        depending on what sort of document you're creating: the
        example is an "article", but you might want to create a
        "book", a "chapter", a "refentry", or something else.</p>

        <p>In terms of the OSWG documentation set, the most common
        type of document is an "article". Articles include HOWTOs,
        mini-HOWTOs, magazine articles, papers, and such. An
        "article" is actually a general class of document that has
        a certain length and structural complexity. Unless you're
        doing a manual page ("man" page) or a proper book, chances
        are that your OSWG document will be an "article".</p>

          the Document Type Declaration</a></h2>

          <p>Assuming that you're marking up an "article", the
          first thing you have to have in your document is the
          document type declaration:</p>

          <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
            <tr>

            </tr>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="STEP2">5.2. Step 2: Adding a
          "root" element</a></h2>

          <p>After that, you have to define the "root" element,
          which will contain all the other elements in your
          document. For an article, the root element is simply
          "article". So, add that, and its end tag after the
          document type declaration:</p>

          <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">

&lt;/article&gt;
</pre>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>Everything else you add to your document will be
          contained within the "article" tags, so when you're done,
          the last tag in your document should be "<tt class= 
          "LITERAL">&lt;/article&gt;</tt>".</p>
        </div>

          <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="STEP3">5.3. Step 3: Adding an
          article header</a></h2>

          <p>Next, you'll want to add some "header" information.
          Header information includes the article's title, the
          author's name and email address, the revision history of
          the document, and lots of other stuff. For now, we'll
          just add the article title and the author name.</p>

&lt;title&gt;The Month of May&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
My summer vacation started on May 14th, right after graduation.  Being a
new, unemployed, and highly-debt-ridden university graduate, I decided
that I should probably get a job.  I spent the vast majority of May
padding my resume with all sorts of impressive-sounding yet terribly
obscure skills and accomplishments, and sending those out to any company
whose name appeared in the phone book.
&lt;/para&gt;
&lt;/sect1&gt;

&lt;/article&gt;
</pre>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>I think you're probably getting the hang of it at this
          point.</p>

          <p>Adding subsections and sub-subsections is also simple.
          A second level section starts and ends with "sect2" tags,
          third level with "sect3", and so on. The standard DocBook
          DTD only supports up to a level 5 section, so there are
          no "sect6", "sect7" or higher tags. Unless you're doing a
          massively long and professional book, however, you
          probably won't need more than 5 section levels.</p>

          <p>Each section level should be contained within a higher
          level, so level 2 sections should be contained by level 1
          sections, and so on. Here's an example:</p>

          <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">

&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;sect2&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My Resume&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
My resume was 4 pages long, and mostly contained notes about my
education and employment history, which was sparse, at best.

&lt;title&gt;Employment History&lt;/title&gt;

Most of the jobs I've ever had have been in the food service industry.
Like most aspiring writers, I spent most of my formative years wiping
tables and grumbling about lousy tips.

          <p>Any DocBook "article" should include an article
          header. The article header contains information such as
          the article title, author, revision history, abstract,
          and so forth.</p>

            "author" element, which might seem like a bit of a
            pain, but it's worth it. The more comprehensive the
            markup, the more we can do with the information when
            processing the document.</p>

          writing, chances are that you're going to have to use
          code samples, filenames, commands, and other
          computer-centric things in your document. DocBook, being
          designed for doing technical documentation, provides tags
          for marking each of these up as a specific type of
          element.</p>

          <div class="SECT3">
            <hr>

            <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="AEN168">6.2.1. Code
            samples</a></h3>

            <p>When you want to include a multiple-line code
            example in your document, you should use the <tt class= 
            "SGMLTAG">programlisting</tt> tag. Here's an example
            that's part of a level 1 section:</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&lt;sect1&gt;
&lt;para&gt;
Here's an example:
&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;programlisting&gt;
if [ $# -eq 1 ]
then
  if [ ! -r $1 ]
  then
    echo Cannot read \"$1\".  Exiting. &gt;&amp;2
    exit 1
  fi
fi
&lt;/programlisting&gt;

&lt;/sect1&gt;
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>The <tt class="SGMLTAG">programlisting</tt> tag is
            usually processed so the output will be rendered with
            all whitespace and formatting preserved, done in a
            fixed-width font, such as courier.</p>

            <p>If you want to include an example of SGML, XML, or
            HTML in your document, you have to use a special bit of
            markup that tells the parser to ignore any tags it
            contains. This special bit of markup is a CDATA marker,
            the beginning of which appears directly after the <tt
            class="SGMLTAG">programlisting</tt> start tag, and
            which ends just before the <tt class="SGMLTAG">
            programlisting</tt> end tag:</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&#13;&lt;programlisting&gt;
&lt;![CDATA[

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Web Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body bgcolor="#ffffff"&gt;
Web Page Content
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

]]&gt;
&lt;/programlisting&gt;&#13;
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Note that the beginning of the CDATA marker is "<tt
            class="LITERAL">&lt;![CDATA[</tt>", and the end of the
            CDATA marker is "<tt class="LITERAL">]]&gt;</tt>". Any
            markup contained between the beginning and end bits of
            a CDATA marker will be ignored by the processing tools
            and treated as if it were just part of the regular
            text.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="SECT3">
            <hr>

            <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="AEN182">6.2.2. Filenames and
            directories</a></h3>

            <p>Appropriately enough, in DocBook you markup
            filenames with a <tt class="SGMLTAG">filename</tt> tag.
            You mark up directories with the same tag, only by
            adding <tt class="LITERAL">class="directory"</tt> as an
            attribute. For example:</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&#13;&lt;para&gt;
When you install DocBook Tools a number of files are added to 
&lt;filename class="directory"&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/filename&gt;, including
&lt;filename&gt;db2html&lt;/filename&gt;, and &lt;filename&gt;db2pdf&lt;/filename&gt;.
&lt;/para&gt;&#13;
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

          <div class="SECT3">
            <hr>

            <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="AEN188">6.2.3.
            Commands</a></h3>

            <p>When you want to mark up a command or command line,
            use the intuitively-named <tt class="SGMLTAG">
            command</tt> tag. For example:</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&#13;&lt;para&gt;
When you want to generate HTML output from your DocBook instance, use
the &lt;command&gt;db2html&lt;/command&gt; command from the command line.
&lt;/para&gt;&#13;
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Often, commands include more than one part, some of
            which, in documentation, are actually "replaceable",
            meaning that they indicate something that can be
            replaced or modified by the user who is typing the
            command. For example:</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&#13;&lt;para&gt;
When you want to generate HTML output from your DocBook instance, type
the following on the command line: &lt;command&gt;db2html
&lt;replaceable&gt;my-filename.sgml&lt;/replaceable&gt;&lt;/command&gt;.
&lt;/para&gt;&#13;
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>You can also mark up command options or flags
            separately as well.</p>

            <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
              <tr>
                <td>
<pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">
&#13;&lt;para&gt;
If you want to generate HTML from your DocBook instance using a
different set of stylesheets, you can use the "-d" option on the command
line:
&lt;/para&gt;

&lt;programlisting&gt;
&lt;command&gt;db2html &lt;option&gt;-d&lt;/option&gt; &lt;/command&gt;
&lt;/programlisting&gt;&#13;
</pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

        <p>So, that's the very quick introduction to how DocBook
        works. This document will expand over time to include a
        reference of various tags and what you should use them for,
        etc. For now, I recommend that you take a look at some of
        the <tt class="FILENAME">*.sgml</tt> files that are
        available through the OSWG website -- with most things, the
        easiest way to learn DocBook is by example. You can find
        links to the OSWG <tt class="FILENAME">*.sgml</tt> files
        here: <a href="http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly/" target= 
        "_top">http://www.oswg.org/oswg-nightly</a>.</p>

        <p>I also recommend that you take the time to look at
        Norman Walsh's <i class="CITETITLE">Docbook: The Definitive
        Guide</i>, the online version of which is available through
        <a href="http://www.docbook.org" target="_top">
        http://www.docbook.org</a>.</p>
