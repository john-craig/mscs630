	Long discussions.

Bruce Schneier
	
	Bruce designed the Blowfish cipher, and his book
	_Applied Cryptography_ is the seminal work in this
	area. I know. Preaching to converted again :)

Steve Reid <sreid@sea-to-sky.net>

	For his public domain implementation of the cast cipher

Peter Guttman <pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz>

	Peter's notes on SFS and memory cell charge dissipation and
	oxidisation proved enlightening. Peter also has a high quality
	crypto-library called `cryptlib'. Which I didn't use, but
	from what I've seen of Peter's work, probably should have.

	nb. Peter, your home page is annoying. very annoying. But no
	doubt incredibly useful if I ever need to plan a covert action
	entry path against the University of Auckland :)

Eric Young <eay@minicom.oz.au>

	SSLeay. What can one say. Eric is the crypto-coders Mahomet, and
	a fellow Aussie to boot :)

Tatu Ylonen <ylo@ssh.fi>

	Some of Ylo's cipher implementations in ssh provided for
	useful study, and gave me an excuse to to not use too much of
        Eric's crypto code ;)

Matthew Green <mrg@eterna.com.au>

	For suggestions on using tsleep()/wakeup() in BSD4.4
	to simulate MUTEX()

Mats Lofkvist <mal@algonet.se>

	Did some nice early alpha testing and provided a patch for
        SIGWINCH handling.

Daniel Assange <lockpick@iq.org>

	For amusing discussions on the whole cryptographic world.

Suelette Dreyfus <suelette@iq.org>

	Strinburg was right. Iasvfoy de muca walks to the east.

Admin Jenkins <jenky@suburbia.net>

	SGML markup of maruguide, nice work on documentation proofing.
