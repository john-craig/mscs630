<h2>          <STRONG><B>RUBBERHOSE</B> review by <i>Steven Baum</i></STRONG>
<p>
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Rubberhose</B> is a deniable cryptography package that lets
someone not wanting to disclose plaintext data corresponding
to their encrypted data show that there is more than one interpretation of the latter.
<P>
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Rubberhose</B> works by initially writing random characters to an
entire hard drive or other dynamic storage device.
This random noise is indistinguishable from the encrypted data
to be stored on that disk.
If you have a 1 GB drive and want to have two <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Rubberhose</B>
encrypted portions of 400 MB and 200 MB, it assumes that each
aspect (as the encrypted partitions are called) will be 1 GB and
fill the entire drive.
It will keep doing this until the drive is really filled to capacity
with encrypted material.
It breaks up the pieces of each aspect into small pieces and
scatters them across the entire 1 GB drive in a random manner,
with each aspect looking as if it is actually
1 GB in size upon decryption.
<P>
Each aspect has its own passphrase that must be separately
decrypted, and if a hard drive is seized neither mathematical
analysis nor physical disk testing can reveal how many aspects
actually exist.
Internal maps are used to locate where the data is stored amongst
the random characters, with each aspect having its own map which
can only be decrypted via its specific passphrase.
As such, a <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Rubberhose</B> disk only be written to after all the
passphrases have been entered.
Everything is works on a "need to know" basis, i.e. each aspect
knows nothing about the others other than when to avoid writing
over the top of another.
<P>
Other features of <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Rubberhose</B> include:
<UL>
<LI>a choice of cryptographic algorithms including DES, 3DES,
IDEA, RC5, Blowfish, Twofish and CAST;
<LI>compatibility with several filesystems including UFS, ext2fs,
FAT and FAT32;
<LI>time-based passphrases, e.g. configuring it to demand re-entry
of a passphrase after a given amount of time or to lock out users
after a specified amount of idle time;
<LI>anti-passphrase-cracking features, e.g. an internally generated
passphrase is generated upon the creation of each new aspect that
is encrypted with the user passphrase for that aspect;
<LI>a design ensuring that if one block of data in an aspect is
decrypted, then it cannot be used to decrypt the remaining blocks;
<LI>frequent block-swapping to confound disk surface analysis
based on the intensity of block use and contiguous block
prediction; and
<LI>"whitening code," i.e. code for the prevention of
plaintext attacks that perturbs the encryption
process in a non-predictable way such that some bits in an
encrypted block are flipped and some aren't.
</UL>
One can't help but admire the motives as well as the skill of those who designed
and built this package:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Rubberhose</B> was originally conceived by <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">crypto</B>-programmer Julian Assange as a tool for human rights workers who needed to
protect sensitive data in the field, particularly lists of activists and details of incidents of abuse. Repressive regimes in places
like East Timor, Russia, Kosovo, Guatemala, Iraq, Sudan and The Congo conduct human rights abuses regularly. Our team has
met with human rights groups and heard first-hand accounts of such abuses. Human rights workers carry vital data on laptops
through the most dangerous situations, sometimes being stopped by military patrols who would have no hesitation in torturing a
suspect until he or she revealed a passphrase to unlock the data. We want to help these sorts of campaigners, particularly the
brave people in the field who risk so much to smuggle data about the abuses out to the rest of the world.
