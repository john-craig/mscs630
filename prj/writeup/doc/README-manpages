The Rubberhose man-page collection was written in a sophisticated sgml
grammer (DTD) called `Docbook'. The Docbook grammer was developed by
the Davenport group and is used by O'Reilly Associates, Sun, DEC, HP
and others to generate most of their technical documentation.

For more information, see http://www.ora.com/Davenport

The sgml parser used was sp/nsgmls (ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/sp) by
James Clark.  transpec/instant from the DEC docbook-to-man converter
(available from the Davenport group url above) provided rendering to
*roff manpage macros.

Some of these packages are available from the BSD ports system in
/usr/ports/textproc

The intolerably flexible Emacs/psgml mode was used for editing the
raw sgml files into their current awful state :)
