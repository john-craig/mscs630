modularity:
	split maru.h into public/private includes

reliability:
	merge make_aspect and buildAspect
	lockf keymap and extent

elegance:
	rewrite option processing to use longer options i.e
	-force rather than -f. do not indulge in FSF --evil.
features:
	traditional steganography (use lsb of 8/16/32/64 bit boundaries)
	finish smart-card support
	attach access for non-root users
	fix password changing
	support for guttman's cryptlib
	MARU_OPTIONS enviromental variable
	networking support for hosed
		SSL networking
		n/m secret splitting of blocks over m servers
		request a block by randomly broadcasting a request
	 	  to the servers involved. writes are a bit trickier, although
	 	  blocks could be given signed generational numbers
		deniable, encrypted, distributed, n/m secret split log-structured
		onion routed block-device! yeah!
		  nb. time to lay off the weed
	n/m secret sharing
	emergency detach
	compression layer
	conventional file encryption using maru keying	
	multiple dependent passphrases per aspect
	convert existing partitions without intermediary
	log structured remap
	 	it's hard to see how to make this deniable, but being
		able to turn any ordinary file system into a log
		structured file system with roll-back is cool
design:
	further abstract crypto / block remapping pipeline to permit:
	
		(a) chaining of algorithms within any pipe stage
		(b) selection of different algorithms
	re-introduce maruCipherDesc->new(), maruCipherDesc->free() now that
	  we are no-longer running ciphers in kernel space.
deniability:
	accelerated burial. Blocks in an extent can be thought of as a forest
	floor. Over time leaves randomly fall and obscure the trail of those
	creatures passing through. After initial extent creation, an initial,
	expensive burying phase can be conducted to make the extent appear an
	indeterminate age. Subequent (more expensive, because data must also be
	read) burying phases can also be conducted. bmap already has slow-burial.
	zero access times on marutukku binary
	recomend starting msetkey etc via cron to touch the file regularly, even
	  when not in use
	discover aspect(s) via passphrase(s), rather than numerical selection
	when hosed is in daemon mode where do we log read/write errors? -- let
	  the user decide with an option
	on initial creation of the extent and maru.iv file, re-write the file
	  several times to make it harder for an attacker to determine usage
	  history
	consider what to do about shell history keeping mechanims. we could 
	  recommend methods to the user to turn these off. Some shell history
 	  keeping mechanisms are high evil, not only including the full arguments
	  to each command, but the exact time as well. BSD style process accounting
	  while it doesn't keep copies of the arguments, also keeps the running
	  time and cpu usage, which can be used to gauge usage. we can use marry(8)
	  techniques to deal with some parts of the PACCT issue.
	process hiding/renaming. hosed should have an option to make it completely
	  invisible or at least randomly masquerade as a commonly used process, the
	  maru module name also needs protection from lsmod. we can also recomend
          that hose is placed in the system startup sequence so recent usage can
	  not be inferred by its presense
	ptrace, memory protection. changing euid's in modern unix kernels flags
	  process resistance to ptrac'ing. in the situation where a maru'er is seized,
	  there is a race between the maru lifetime and or idle timeouts with
	  the attackers ability to get root -> hosed internal state. in general
	  this problem seems unsolvable, but there are two solutions, one of
	  which may be rigorous (althought daunting to write). For the first problem,
	  we can suggest the usage of standard compartmentalisation techniques,
	  secure-levels etc. The primary motivation here is to prevent dumping and
	  modification of /dev/kmem and /proc/hosed/mem etc. The second solution
	  is quite interesting. live key, subkey material can occulted by placing it
	  within randomly within a region of randomly generated bits. if there are
	  enough inter-dependent peices of key-material or these peices are split
	  into enough futures peices, the problem of locating the true key
	  material can be computational intractable. Unfortunately pointers within
	  hosed must still know how to get at this key material.
	instead of just having an idle-lifetime, track the user's keypress behavior,
	  and if there is a sudden change in it, request rekeying. this
	  needs to be flexible enough to handle different behavior modes (e.g vi/nethack
	  hijkl etc) in its training. this could be quite interesting and effective.
	modify extent wiping algorithm to be idenditical to block encryption algorithm
	
crypto:
	add additional key mashing stage, for
	  ciphers with short keys.
	support 128 bit block ciphers
	fix native blowfish
	finish native rc5

kernel:
 BSD44:
	cache purge redundent lower-layer cache
	zero plain text disk/vm cache on detach
	fix hanging reference count
	bypass kue ioctl kapi kludge (we can use a two pass modload instead)
	debug and stress stest

hosed:
	mmap extent, set MMAP_WONTNEED to clear lower layer buffer cache
	use fdatasync()
	
regress:
	64 bit boundaries satisfied
	endianness for maru.iv and maru.extent
	test vectors
	concurrent thrash tests
	verify aspect blocks do not over-lap
	verify extent size = block size * block length
	verify first and last blocks of extent are readable

misc:
	remove incomplete maru.iv (etc) on key-gen interruption
	Debug printing macros
	Consistant m_u64 type pointer arguments for all functions
	requiring 64 bit aligned data.

build-system:
	install: target
	  initial setup scripts. init.d scripts. etc. important!
	startup-scripts
	investigate using cook / bsdmake. AUTOMAKE MUST DIE

	finish integration of confused.
