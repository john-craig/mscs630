>You can hide information effectively and safely.</P
><P
>Here's a simple example of Rubberhose's usefulness. Rashid, a civil rights
community activist, has three types of data on his computer: his bank
statements, a list of witnesses statements about a government-instigated
death squad attack on a rural village, and his mother's recipe for rhubarb
tart. The tart recipe, and, to a lesser degree, his banks statements, are
his cover. They provide decoy data for the more explosive witness statements
underneath.</P
><P
>In the middle of the night, military security forces raid Rashid's home,
take him prisoner and seize his computer. Computer experts at the Ministry
of Cleansing of Public Ideas examine his machine and find that the hard
drive is encrypted. They demand the passphrase in less than subtle ways in
order to decrypt the data. Rashid gives them a passphrase. They decrypt the
data and discover a recipe for rhubarb tart. They poke around the drive, but
they can not see any other encrypted data, because there is no tractable way
to show the existence of any other data hidden among the rhubarb. They are
frustrated and angry but can trump up no suitable charges to hold Rashid. 
There is no way for the interrogators -- or Rashid himself -- to prove he has
handed over all the passphrases. 
Finally releasing him and his computer, the interrogators never know the
bank statements or witness statements are on the machine.</P
><P
>Rubberhose also allows you to pass information around to a group of people, but
only allow certain people to access certain material. Rashid might, for
example, discover his colleague Leila is on a military hit list and need to
smuggle her out of the country to safety. To do this, she will need to pass
through four or five safe-houses run by secret sympathizers on the way to
the border. Rashid knows all the safe houses, but he does not want them to
know about each other for fear that if the military regime seized one
person, the other four will be at risk. So Rashid gives Leila a floppy disk
with the list of safe-houses -- but each name is encrypted with a different
passphrase. Each secret sympathizer knows his or her own passphrase. When
Leila arrives at a safe house, she gives the diskette to the sympathizer,
who decrypts his portion which contains the address of the next safe house
in the chain. Leila never knows the entire list of safe house sympathizers
until she is safely over the border; if she is ever intercepted en route
with the diskette the list of names is safe. Other crucial information can
also be passed along a human chain in this way.</P
><P
>The multi-passphrase security feature which allows information hiding only
works for reading data. You can only safely write to the diskette or other
data storage device with Rubberhose if you know all the passphrases.  If you try
to write to the disk without first decrypting the entire disk, you risk
overwriting information stored in some other encrypted portion. If however
if it more important to keep the information hidden than it is to keep it
intact, this shouldn't bother you. Rubberhose will allow you to over-write the
material. Naturally the program will not warn you that you are doing so,
however, as this might tip off an adversary that there is something far more
valuable than just a tart hiding in the Rubberhose disk. </P
